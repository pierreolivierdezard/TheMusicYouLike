    <h1>Documentation & details</h1>
    <p>
        I think I completed all the requirements for this project.
        I commented my code, did a proper indentation and I used naming conventions, snake case for functions and camel case for variables.
        I’ll describe below the main problems I have faced during this project.
    </p>
    <h3>1.	Prioritize & Time Management</h3>
    <p>
        For this assessement, i didn't have big issues as i had in the previous one, stucked during days on a thing.
        However, we had a lot of functionnality to implement and i saw that i have to prioritize them.
        Moreover, we didn't do basic PHP anymore and we have to learn how to really use Laravel with complex objects as Collections, Builders, which methods i can use with them ...
        So i spend a lot of time reading documentation.
        For instance, i spent a lot of time to retrieve my numbers of comments notificaiton, and i realized that i had to stop thinking about it, do the main functionnalities like friendship and privacy before thinking about little things like this.<br>
        That is a really good exercise because, during my internship, the first thing we did when we started a project was to plan which functionnalities we will develop first and that's what i should have done. 
    </p>
    <h3>2.	Feedback</h3>
    <p>
        As i said, i didn't have big issues. The only thing i wanted to add to my website was to remove users images and posts images from my public folder when i remove a post or a user.<br><br>
        But i'd like to give you a feedback about this trimester and this course as an international student.<br><br>
        I really enjoy this trimester and the way that you teach coding.
        That is really different from France where we have still an 'old' model with lecture in class and then lab where we are doing half of what the teacher ask and we do nothing at home ...
        Here we are really free to manage our time as we want and at the same time we have to be really autonomous and work to have a good mark at the lab session.
        That is even more enjoyable when you are an international student and you want to travel around, we can travel and work on our computer at the same time !
        I think it's really relevant from our time, today with internet and computers, we don't need to be at the office 24h/24h !
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Thank you for having a read and paying attention to my work, I hope it will satisfy you.<br><br>
        Regards,<br><br>
